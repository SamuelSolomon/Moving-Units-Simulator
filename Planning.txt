# walkingUnitsApp - the actual graphical interface class with the buttons and labels and fields
	#variables
	# window - contains 1 frame
	# frame - contains graphical field and buttons
	# model - instance of the walking units model
	# graphical field - where things are drawn
	# enqueue button - runs the enqueue method in the model, passes it a unit
	# dequeue button - runs the dequeue method in the model
	# timer - some way of determining when the units move and are redrawn
	#methods
	# draw - erase and redraw each unit as its own position on the field.

# walkingUnitsModel - the class that runs the units on the path and changes postions and whatnot.
	#variables
	# path - a list of x and y and coordinates
	# queuedUnits - a linked queue of unit objects
	# movingUnits - a list of units that are moving
	#methods
	# enqueue - makes a unit object and pushes it into queued units
	# dequeue - pops from the queued units and places it into the moving units list
	# step - takes a unit, calls next on it's coordinate node
	# move - calls the step method on every unit is the moving units list, removes units at the end from the list
	
# unit - a picture and a set of x and y coordinates
	#variables
	# graphic
	# position - a node containing x and y coordinates
	#methods
	# next - node = node.next
	# get and set graphic
	# get and set position node
	# get x and y seperatly
